# Chapter 1 Introduction

**Objective:** Establish the framework of economic analysis —
preferences, choices, and basic optimization.

## 1.1 Economic Agents and Choice

An economic agent faces alternatives and must choose. The essence of
microeconomics lies in modeling **choice under scarcity** and **rational
decision-making**.

### Rationality

*An agent is rational if preferences are complete and transitive.*

-   **Completeness:** For any two alternatives ( x, y ), either (x
    \succeq y), (y \succeq x), or both.
-   **Transitivity:** If (x \succeq y) and (y \succeq z), then (x
    \succeq z).

### Choice Correspondence

A choice correspondence (C(A)) selects a subset of (A) that the agent
prefers most according to her preference relation (\succeq).

> A rational preference relation induces a well-defined choice rule.

## 1.2 Optimization

Agents are assumed to **maximize** some objective (utility, profit,
etc.) subject to constraints.

The solution concept is: \[ x\^\* \in \arg\max\_{x \in X} u(x), \] where
(X) is the feasible set and (u) is the utility function representing
preferences.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Chapter 2 Preferences and Utility

## 2.1 Preference Relations

A **preference relation** (\succeq) on a choice set (X) satisfies:

-   **Reflexivity:** (x \succeq x)
-   **Completeness**
-   **Transitivity**

From these, we get a ranking of items.

## 2.2 Utility Representation

A utility function (u: X \to \mathbb{R}) represents (\succeq) if: \[ x
\succeq y \iff u(x) \ge u(y). \]

### Theorem (Utility Representation)

If (\succeq) is complete, transitive, and continuous, then a continuous
utility function exists.

Proof sketch: - Continuity ensures upper and lower contour sets are
closed. - This permits construction of a real-valued mapping preserving
ordering.

## 2.3 Numerical vs. Ordinal Utility

-   **Ordinal utility:** Ranking of bundles; cardinal meaning is
    irrelevant.
-   Only preference ordering matters.

## 2.4 Monotonicity and Convexity

### Monotonicity

More is better: If (x \ge y) component-wise, then (x \succeq y).

### Convex Preferences

If (x \succeq y), then for any (0\le \alpha\le 1): \[ \alpha x +
(1-\alpha) y \succeq y. \] This captures **diversification** or
preference for averages.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Chapter 3 Utility Maximization

## 3.1 Consumer Choice Problem

Given:

-   A price vector (p \in \mathbb{R}\^n\_{++}),
-   Income (m \> 0),

The consumer solves: \[ \max\*{x\* \\in \\mathbb{R}\\\^n+} u(x)
\quad \text{s.t.} \quad p \cdot x \le m. \]

## 3.2 Budget Set

\[ B(p,m) = {x \ge 0: p \cdot x \le m}. \]

## 3.3 Solutions and Demand

The solution to the maximization yields the **Marshallian
(uncompensated) demand** (x(p,m)).

### Interior Solution Conditions

With differentiable utility and interior optimality: \[
\frac{\partial u / \partial x_i}{\partial u / \partial x_j} =
\frac{p_i}{p_j}, \quad \forall i,j. \]

This is the **tangency condition**.

## 3.4 Indirect Utility

Define the **indirect utility function**: \[ v(p,m) = u(x(p,m)), \] the
maximum utility given prices and income.

Properties:

-   Homogeneous of degree 0 in ((p,m)),
-   Non-increasing in prices,
-   Non-decreasing in income.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Chapter 4 Expenditure Minimization and Duality

## 4.1 Expenditure Minimization

Rather than maximizing utility subject to a budget, an alternative
perspective: \[ e(p, u_0) = \min\_{x \ge 0} p \cdot x \quad \text{s.t.}
\quad u(x) \ge u_0, \] where (u_0) is a target utility level.

## 4.2 Hicksian Demand

The minimizer (h(p, u_0)) is called the **Hicksian (compensated)
demand**.

-   It depends on prices and utility level.
-   Compensates the consumer for price changes while holding utility
    constant.

## 4.3 Expenditure Function

Properties:

1.  **Homogeneity of degree 1 in prices:** (e(\alpha p, u_0) = \alpha
    e(p, u_0))
2.  **Non-decreasing in prices**
3.  **Non-decreasing in (u_0)**

## 4.4 Duality

Key relationships:

### Shephard’s Lemma

\[ \frac{\partial e(p, u)}{\partial p_i} = h_i(p,u). \]

This links Hicksian demand directly to expenditure derivatives.

### Roy’s Identity

\[ x_i(p,m) =
-\frac{\partial v(p,m)/\partial p_i}{\partial v(p,m)/\partial m}. \]

This derives Marshallian demand from the indirect utility.

# Visualizing Consumer Optimization

**Primal problem:** maximize utility on the budget line\
→ solution (x(p,m))

**Dual problem:** minimize expenditure subject to utility target\
→ solution (h(p,u))

Duality shows these perspectives are consistent and linked.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What You Should Know by End of Part I

1.  Rational preferences imply utility ordering.
2.  Utility maximization leads to observable demand functions.
3.  Expenditure minimization gives compensating variation measures.
4.  Duality (Shephard & Roy) bridges demand and expenditure in a
    systematic way.
