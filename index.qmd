## About Me

I am a Kathmandu-based researcher and lecturer with a strong academic foundation in economics.  
My teaching and research interests include microeconomics, macroeconomics, applied economics, and data science applications in public policy.  

I have been engaged in tutoring economics at NIST for the past three years and conducting R for Data Science sessions at GRIT.  
I am passionate about data-driven research, policy analysis, and promoting local economic development.
