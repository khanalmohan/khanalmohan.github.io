## About Me

I am a Kathmandu-based researcher and lecturer with a strong academic foundation in economics.  
My teaching and research interests include microeconomics, macroeconomics, applied economics, and data science applications in public policy.

I am engaged in tutoring econometrics and behavioral economics for **Fall 2025** at undergraduate level and conducting **R for Data Science** sessions.  
I am passionate about data-driven research, policy analysis, and promoting local economic development.
