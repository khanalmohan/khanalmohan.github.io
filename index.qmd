### About Me

Mohan Khanal is a Kathmandu-based researcher and lecturer with a strong
academic foundation in economics and an interest in using data to inform
public policy. He holds a Master of Arts in Economics from Tribhuvan
University, where he focused on microeconomics, public economics, and
development issues, and a Bachelor of Business Administration from
Kathmandu University.

Mohan’s research spans diverse themes such as tobacco control, inclusive
education, vocational training, and social protection. He has worked on
several interdisciplinary projects that involved field coordination,
survey design, interviews, and policy reporting. His motivation lies in
understanding how economic tools can improve lives—especially in
developing country contexts.

Alongside research, Mohan teaches undergraduate economics courses,
including microeconomics and macroeconomics, to students from business,
technology, and information systems backgrounds. His teaching blends
conceptual clarity with real-world applications, and he actively mentors
students on writing and presenting academic work.

Mohan has presented his work at academic conferences and is passionate
about making research both rigorous and relevant. He values
collaboration and continuous learning and is particularly interested in
inequality, health, and labor markets.

Outside of work, Mohan enjoys playing the keyboard and guitar,
participating in futsal matches, and following test cricket with
enthusiasm. He is also involved in student-led academic forums and
environmental awareness activities, reflecting his belief in community
engagement and communication.
